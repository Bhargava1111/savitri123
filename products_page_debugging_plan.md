# Products Page Debugging Plan

**Problem:** Products are not showing on the products page.

**Plan:**

1.  **Investigate Network Errors:**
    *   Investigate the specific errors in the network tab. This will help determine if the issue is related to the API endpoint, request headers, or response format.
    *   Examine the request URL, status code, and response body to understand the nature of the error.
2.  **Verify API Endpoint:**
    *   Confirm that the API endpoint used to fetch products is correct and accessible. The endpoint should match the one defined in `src/services/ProductService.ts` and `server/server.js`.
    *   Check if the server is running on the correct port and if there are any firewall rules blocking access to the API endpoint.
3.  **Examine Request Headers:**
    *   Inspect the request headers to ensure that they are correctly set. This includes checking the `Content-Type` header and any authorization headers.
4.  **Analyze Response Body:**
    *   If the API endpoint is accessible and the request headers are correct, analyze the response body to see if the server is returning the expected data.
    *   Check if the response is in the correct format (JSON) and if it contains any error messages.
5.  **Debug Frontend Code:**
    *   If the response body is empty or contains an error message, debug the frontend code in `src/pages/ProductsPage.tsx` and `src/services/ProductService.ts` to trace the product data flow.
    *   Use `console.log` statements to print the data at different stages of the process and identify where the issue is occurring.
6.  **Check Database:**
    *   If the frontend code is working correctly, check the database (`db.json` in `server/server.js`) to see if the product data is present and valid.
    *   Verify that the `is_active` field is set to `true` for all products that should be displayed on the products page.
7.  **Test with Mock Data:**
    *   Temporarily switch to using the mock data in `src/data/products.ts` to see if the products are displayed correctly. This will help determine if the issue is related to the API or the frontend code.
8.  **Identify Root Cause:**
    *   Based on the information gathered from the previous steps, identify the root cause of the issue and develop a solution.
9.  **Implement Solution:**
    *   Implement the solution by modifying the relevant code in the frontend, backend, or database.
10. **Test Solution:**
    *   Test the solution thoroughly to ensure that the products are displayed correctly on the products page.
11. **Deploy Changes:**
    *   Deploy the changes to the production environment.
